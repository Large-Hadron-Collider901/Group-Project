# Project Prep # 1
 By Skye McCullough, Shanythia Richards, and Brittani Morganfield 

## Cooperation Plan

* As a team, all of us specialize in front-end work, we are confident in our html/css skills and our ability to work together in order to improve our script writing skills and complete this project
* Our approach to making sure everyone understand all aspects of the project, we are going to divide the work, taking turns writing different parts of our code so we can all take our breaks, and then once a milestone is reached we are going to meet together to discuss what we have done. This way, we can make sure we understand everything in our code and we can ask any questions we might have about our teammates code

## Conflict Plan

* Our group decided the best way to go about conflict resolution is to set a schedule that gives us time to communicate about how the project is going, our plans fo it, and how we can incorporate all of them properly. With us already having an established friendship, we have many ways to communicate with each other to discuss our thoughts, concerns, and other feelings to each other.
