# Project Prep # 1
 By Skye McCullough, Shanythia Richards, and Brittani Morganfield 

## Cooperation Plan

* As a team, all of us specialize in front-end work, we are confident in our html/css skills and our ability to work together in order to improve our script writing skills and complete this project
* Our approach to making sure everyone understand all aspects of the project, we are going to divide the work, taking turns writing different parts of our code so we can all take our breaks, and then once a milestone is reached we are going to meet together to discuss what we have done. This way, we can make sure we understand everything in our code and we can ask any questions we might have about our teammates code

## Conflict Plan

* Our group decided the best way to go about conflict resolution is to set a schedule that gives us time to communicate about how the project is going, our plans fo it, and how we can incorporate all of them properly. With us already having an established friendship, we have many ways to communicate with each other to discuss our thoughts, concerns, and other feelings to each other.

## Communication Plan

We have a plan to work during lab hours and after 7 so we can all contribute to the project. We have each other's numbers, we have a chat in Slack, and we communicate through Discord. We will take breaks between us meeting during lab time and the 7 o'clock hour. Again, we have each other's numbers so if we ever need to get to a team member quickly, that is the best way. To make sure everyone is heard, we will all share ideas with each other and find ways to incorporate them in the best way possible. Taking time to make sure everyone is happy with the progress we've made and allowing everyone to express their thoughts or concerns is important for this project to flourish.

## Work Plan

By understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses, we can draft up ideas on what we want our website to be about, how it will function, and how it will be presented. A detailed wireframe and the schedule made through Google Calendar will act as day-by-day with, keeping track of progress and setting focus days we will split the workload quickly and effectively.

## Git Plan

We will communicate in real time through Discord's call option so we all know when someone is working in the file. This will allow one person to work in it while other members brainstorm what they will do once itâ€™s their turn to add to the file.
